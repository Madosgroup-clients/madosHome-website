                            policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in

                            conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information
                            from California
                            consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the

                            those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.
